# BattleBuddy
.Net api for managing TTRPG combat.

## Running the app
This project uses dotnet cli.
`dotnet run --project ./BattleBuddy.Api/BattleBuddy.Api.csproj`
With .Net 9

## Considerations
Typically for an app this size I wouldn't use a layered architecture since its a bit overkill but I thought it was an important demonstration.
